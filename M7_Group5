## Problem 2a
#Import the data into a dataframe.
USArrests <- read.csv("USArrests.csv", row.names = 1)

#Scale the dataset because the variables have very different ranges. Without scaling, the assault will dominate distance calculations.
USArrests_scale <- scale(USArrests)

set.seed(1)

#Run k-means for k = 2,3,4,5
km2 <-kmeans(USArrests_scale, centers = 2, nstart = 20)
km3 <-kmeans(USArrests_scale, centers = 3, nstart = 20)
km4 <-kmeans(USArrests_scale, centers = 4, nstart = 20)
km5 <-kmeans(USArrests_scale, centers = 5, nstart = 20)

#Interpretation: K = 2 produces a clear high-crime vs low-crime split. One cluster contains the high murder, assault, and rape rates while the other shows lower violent crime rates. It is vey interpretable. K=3 adds a middle crime group but the boundaries between these three clusters is less distinct. K = 4 has further segmentation and the clusters are smaller and harder to interpret. K = 5 has even finer granularity but risks over-segmentation. Some clusters only differe slightly and it is hard to justify the five different clusters when thinking of how it can be interpreted.K = 2 would be th best choice because it has the highest cluster separation and clear interpretation. It avoids overfitting and it the most defensible choice when thinking of logic. If a larger k were chosen, it would lead to finer segmentation for decision making but would be hard to justify and interpret.
